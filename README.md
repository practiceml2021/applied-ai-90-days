# Applied AI – 90 Day Commitment

## Commitment
For the next 90 days, I commit to becoming an Applied AI Engineer by building agentic systems, shipping weekly, and publishing my work publicly.

## Rules
- Code daily
- Ship weekly
- No tutorials during build time
- No skipping sleep or workouts
- Output > understanding

## Weekly Deliverables
- Week 1: Task Breakdown Agent
- Week 2: Research Agent
- Week 3: Automation Agent

## Progress Log
- Day 1: Project initialized
- Day 2: Task Breakdown Agent working
- Day 3: Agent writes timestamped task plans to disk
- Day 4: Graceful handling of failures
- Day 5: Task Breakdown Agent demo (see demos/task_agent_demo_day5.mp4)
- Day 6: Added executor that executes tasks assigned by planner
